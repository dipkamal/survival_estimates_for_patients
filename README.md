# Survival estimates for patients
We will build some of the statistical models to analyze surivival estimates for a dataset of lymphoma patients. We'll also evaluate these models and interpret their outputs. 
We will also be learning about the following:
1. Censored Data
2. Kaplan-Meier Estimates
3. Subgroup Analysis
